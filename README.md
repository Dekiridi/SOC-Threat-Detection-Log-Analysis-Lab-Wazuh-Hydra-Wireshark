# SOC Detection Lab: Hydra, Wireshark, Wazuh, pfSense

🚀 **Career Pivot in Action: From Banking & Finance to SOC Analyst**

This repository contains artifacts from a hands-on cybersecurity capstone project aimed at simulating and detecting network threats in a controlled environment. The project showcases a complete detection and defense workflow using industry-standard tools.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a realistic SOC (Security Operations Center) lab to detect and respond to brute-force SSH attacks, enhancing cybersecurity skills in threat detection, network security, and incident response.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Wireshark** – for network traffic capture and analysis 📊
- **Hydra** – for controlled SSH brute-force attack simulations 🛠️
- **Wazuh SIEM (v4.11.1)** – for real-time security monitoring and threat detection ⚡
- **pfSense** – for firewall protection and network segmentation 🔐
- **VirtualBox** – for lab virtualization and network isolation 🖥️

---

## 📈 Lab Workflow

1. **Capture baseline traffic** using Wireshark.
2. **Simulate brute-force attack** on SSH with Hydra.
3. **Detect and alert** on suspicious activity with Wazuh.
4. **Implement network hardening** with pfSense.
5. **Analyze network events** and translate findings into business risk language.
